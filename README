[ this is -*-Text-*- ]

This is Jade 4.0 alpha, an Emacs-like text editor for UNIX/X11. It is
known to compile on at least Solaris/sparc and Linux/ix86; it is
released under the terms of the GNU GPL, copyright John Harper
<john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

This is a snapshot of the CVS repository:

	http://sprite.dcs.warwick.ac.uk:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb

but it should be pretty stable (I use it constantly, with very few
problems). However the TeXinfo manual in the man/ directory has not
been updated since the last major release, and as such is massively out
of date. For more details see the url

	http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~john/jade/

To compile this snapshot you'll need GNU Autoconf, GNU make, and
(currently) GCC, run aclocal and autoconf in the root of the
distribution to create a configure script, then compile as normal
(generic instructions in the INSTALL file).

You'll also need an installed copy of my librep LISP interpreter,
this should be able to be found in the same place as this snapshot.

If you compile for the GTK window-system (i.e. you don't give configure
the --disable-gtk option), then you'll also need the rep-gtk GTK
binding installed. This is available from the same place as the librep
distribution.

Please send any success or failure reports to the email address above.
