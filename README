[ this is -*-Text-*- ]

This is Jade 4.0 alpha, an Emacs-like text editor for UNIX/X11. It is
known to compile on at least Solaris/sparc and Linux/ix86; it is
released under the terms of the GNU GPL, copyright John Harper
<john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

This is a snapshot of the CVS repository:

	http://sprite.dcs.warwick.ac.uk:8080/cgi-bin/cvsweb

but it should be pretty stable (I use it constantly, with very few
problems). However the TeXinfo manual in the man/ directory has not
been updated since the last major release, and as such is massively out
of date. For more details see the url

	http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~john/jade/

To compile this snapshot you'll need GNU Autoconf, GNU make, and
(currently) GCC, run autoconf in the root of the distribution to create
a configure script, then compile as normal (generic instructions in the
INSTALL file).

Please send any success or failure reports to the email address above.
