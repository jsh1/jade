  abstract =     "The problem of finding a longest common subsequence of
                 two strings is discussed. This problem arises in data
                 processing applications such as comparing two files and
                 in genetic applications such as studying molecular
                 evolution. The difficulty of computing a longest common
                 subsequence of two strings is examined using the
                 decision tree model of computation, in which vertices
                 represent ``equal --- unequal'' comparisons. It is
                 shown that unless a bound on the total number of
                 distinct symbols is assumed, every solution to the
                 problem can consume an amount of time that is
                 proportional to the product of the lengths of the two
                 strings. A general lower bound as a function of the
                 ratio of alphabet size to string length is derived. The
                 case where comparisons between symbols of the same
                 string are forbidden is also considered and it is shown
                 that this problem is of linear complexity for a
                 two-symbol alphabet and quadratic for an alphabet of
                 three or more symbols.",

                 text into an improved version by means of editing
                 operations. With some enhancement, existing
                 file-comparison algorithms can produce the information

                 introduction of logical levels in files, selection of a

                 detection and analysis of similarity. An algorithm that
                 incorporates these modifications is described.
                 Illustrative of the use of the file-comparison model, a
                 high-level editing sequence for a particular text
                 editor and a particular editing task is automatically
